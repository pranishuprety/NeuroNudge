          <h1>Mindful Nudges. Parental Control. Digital Wellbeing.</h1>
          <p>
            NeuroNudge is a Chromium-based extension that helps users stay balanced by reducing distraction, overworking, and digital overload. It adapts to your browsing rhythm, spotting small signs of drift and gently guiding you back before focus fades. For parents, the Parent Mode adds smart guardrails that help children build healthy screen habits, especially on school Chromebooks widely used from middle school through high school. When deeper support is needed, the Amazon Nova ACT assistant provides personalized routines that restore focus and flow.

          <h2>Why we built NeuroNudge</h2>
          <p>
            We built NeuroNudge to help people build a healthier relationship with technology. Screens are part of nearly every moment of modern life, and it is easy to lose focus, overwork, or drift without realizing it. NeuroNudge helps you stay centered by sensing when your attention starts to fade, guiding you back to focus, and reminding you to take mindful breaks before exhaustion sets in. It is designed for anyone who wants to work or study with purpose, and for parents who want to create balance and safety for their kids online.

            <h3>Burnout on repeat</h3>
            <p>
              Knowledge workers sprint late into the night, only to hit walls the next morning. NeuroNudge spots overworking
              patterns and nudges toward purposeful breaks long before exhaustion wins.

            <p>
              Students jump between tabs, losing track of time and expectations. Gentle prompts and timer caps keep attention
              anchored without shaming curiosity.

            <p>
              Families want screen time to cultivate hobbies, not steal sleep. Parent Mode shapes those boundaries alongside kids
              instead of locking them out.

              Classrooms lean on Chromebooks because they are simple and managed. NeuroNudge layers local rules and focus caps, and
              Nova ACT scripts personalized reset rituals whenever students get stuck.

            NeuroNudge started at HackPrinceton Fall 2025 as an experiment in adaptive productivity support. It senses
            the subtle behavioral cues that precede drift and delivers compassionate prompts to keep you in the flow

            Set clear guardrails for the sites that drain focus. Parent Mode lives entirely on the device,
            giving families Chromebook-ready controls without new accounts or dashboards. Keep social tabs closed during
            class and let curiosity roam again once the school day wraps. Nova routines add creative breaks when kids (or parents)
            need a reset.

              calming reminder page if they pop up—ideal for shared family laptops and managed school Chromebooks.

              Add daily caps or per-session timers for specific sites. When the limit is reached, the browser
              pauses that destination until it resets, encouraging breaks, stretches, and real-world conversation. Nova can even lead
              a short reset ritual before letting students hop back in.
